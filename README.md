# Beef-WebSocket

BeefLang WebSocket library, for now a simple, but working, WebSocket server.

## Dependencies
[Beef-Net](https://github.com/tomwjerry/Beef-Net) for networking

[Beef-OpenSSL](https://github.com/thibmo/Beef-OpenSSL) maybe not needed

[beef_sead](https://github.com/tomwjerry/beef_sead) for base64, yes I know Beef-Net has one too. It should not be there...

[Beef Crypto](https://github.com/tomwjerry/Beef-Crypto) for one tiny file to do Sha1 hasing. I like to divide things
